# Hangman Project

## Overview
The Hangman project is a simple, text-based word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list and displays the word with underscores representing unguessed letters. Players guess letters one at a time, and the game provides feedback on whether the guessed letter is in the word. If the guessed letter is in the word, the program reveals its position(s); if not, it counts as an incorrect guess, and a part of the hangman graphic is drawn. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or reaches the maximum number of incorrect guesses. This project was developed as part of our coursework in the G7SCM module by Jeet Biswas, Jitesh Jain, and Juppuneet Singh.
